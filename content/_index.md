      text: "<p class='text-center'>I moved to Paris in 2019 to pursue a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Economics at University Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne. In my third year, introductory courses in development economics and econometrics were decisive. They inspired me to build my academic path at the intersection of these fields and led to my first applied research project: The Impact of Climate Change on Migration Flows. I then joined the Master‚Äôs program in Development Economics at Paris 1, where I strengthened my theoretical and econometric foundations. This program also gave me hands-on experience with impact evaluation methods through two dissertations, including Debt and Growth: Evidence from Firm-Level Data, supervised by Marin Ferry.During this research, I joined the ERUDITE lab for a first internship, which confirmed my growing enthusiasm for academic work. Wanting to sharpen my research agenda before starting a PhD, I enrolled in the Master 2 program in Development Economics & International Project Management (Impact Evaluation track) at Universit√© Gustave Eiffel. This year broadened my methodological skills and interdisciplinary outlook. It also gave me the opportunity to complete a second ERUDITE internship, resulting in Public Debt and Firm Performance: A Love-Hate Relationship?, again supervised by Marin Ferry. This experience provided the space I needed to refine the research questions I now aim to explore in my PhD. Over time, my interest turned toward China for several reasons: Xi Jinping‚Äôs large-scale anti-corruption campaign launched in 2012; the striking contrast between pervasive corruption and rapid economic growth; the absence of a strict separation of powers; and the unique interaction between centralized political authority and decentralized regional economies. These reflections led to my current doctoral project, ‚ÄúCorruption and Economic Distortions: The Example of China,‚Äù which aims to shed light on the mechanisms through which corruption shapes investment and competition dynamics within China‚Äôs institutional framework. Looking forward to connecting and exchanging at DebtCon8!</p>"
